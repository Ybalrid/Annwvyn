TODO : 
- Leap Rotation in plane
  x' = cos(theta)*(x-xc) - sin(theta)*(y-yc) + xc
  y' = sin(theta)*(x-xc) + cos(theta)*(y-yc) + yc

TODO in future release 
- allow playing multiple animations
- HUD
- add debug drawing for trigger position when debug drawing is active for bullet

DONE : 
- general collision detection callback
- triggers
- play objects animations
- Skydome
- easy raycasting to figure where the player is looking
