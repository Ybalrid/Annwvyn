You need to link :

Ogre >= 1.9.0 && < 2 (for now, 2.0 branch is under development, I tried it for fun, not a good idea...)
Bullet >= 2.8
OpenAL
libsndfile

for windows :
OVR 0.2.4 or higher
+ join libsndfile, openAl and all needed Ogre dlls (lib + plugins)

for GNU/Linux :
0.2.4 or higher
+ join Ogre *.so plugins files along your executable (or just specify the place they have to be on your system in plugin.cfg)
Make sure the Ogre shared objects directory is on your ld.so.conf, in some distrib, ld does not search on the /usr/local/lib directory.



Included libraries : (compiled with the source code)
BtOgre
OgreOculus modified, (I will update my personal fork of Kojack's work later...)
