You need to link :

Ogre 1.9.x
Bullet >= 2.8
OpenAL lattest available
libsndfile lattest available 
libOVR 0.2.5
CEGUI >0.8.2 (Build with your own Ogre build, we need the OgreRenderer to use the correct version of Ogre)

for windows :
Please use the SDK from http://annwvyn.org/

for GNU/Linux :
0.2.4 or higher
+ join Ogre *.so plugins files along your executable (or just specify the place they have to be on your system in plugin.cfg)
Make sure the Ogre shared objects directory is on your ld.so.conf, in some distrib, ld does not search on the /usr/local/lib for exemple directory.


Included libraries : (compiled with the source code)
BtOgre
OgreOculus modified, (I will update my personal fork of Kojack's work later...)
