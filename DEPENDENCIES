You need to link :

Ogre >= 1.9.0 && < 2 (for now, 2.0 branch is under development, I tried it for fun, not a good idea...)
Bullet >= 2.8
OpenAL
libsndfile
libOVR
CEGUI >= 0.8.2

for windows :
Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 
OVR 0.2.4 or higher
+ join libsndfile, openAl and all needed Ogre dlls (lib + plugins)

+ set some environement variable to build directly the dynamic lib :
OGRE_ROOT : where you have installed your Ogre SDK
OVR_ROOT : where you have installed your OVR SDK (LibOVR subdirectory)
BULLET_ROOT : where you have Compilled bullet (with msvc 2010 !!)
AL_ROOT : where you have installed your OpenAL SDK
SNDFILE_ROOT : where you have installed your libsndfile (from mega-nerd website)

All these variables will be used as referencies on the provided VisualStudio projects and solutions.

for GNU/Linux :
0.2.4 or higher
+ join Ogre *.so plugins files along your executable (or just specify the place they have to be on your system in plugin.cfg)
Make sure the Ogre shared objects directory is on your ld.so.conf, in some distrib, ld does not search on the /usr/local/lib directory.
