For building the engine, you need to link :

Ogre 1.9.x
Bullet >= 2.8
OpenAL lattest available should work
libsndfile lattest available should work
libOVR 1.3.0

On Windows you can download the SDK from http://annwvyn.org/
You'll need MSVC 2012 to build Annwvyn. The embeded boost version is build with vctoolkit 11.
The SDK is probably not up to date, but it contain a full copy of this repo. You can just "git pull" the Annwvyn repository and rebuild the msvc solution under Annwvyn/msvc/Annwvyn.sln

Included libraries : (compiled with the source code)
BtOgre
tinyXml2
