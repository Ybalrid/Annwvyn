For building the engine, you need to link :

Ogre 1.9.x 
Bullet >= 2.8
OpenAL lattest available should work
libsndfile lattest available should work
libOVR 1.8 from the Oculus developer center
OpenVR 1.0.3 from https://github.com/ValveSoftware/openvr

You should download the SDK from http://annwvyn.org/
You'll need MSVC 2015 to build Annwvyn.
The SDK is probably not up to date, but it contain a full copy of this repo. 
You can just "git pull" the Annwvyn repository after installation and then rebuild the msvc 
solution under <Annwvyn git repo>/msvc/Annwvyn/Annwvyn.sln

Included libraries : (compiled with the source code)
BtOgre        :A "thin" layer between bullet and Ogre
tinyXml2      :A super small (2 files?) and easy to use XML lib
Ogre::Euler   :A small addition to Ogre that add a class that represent (and convert to/from quaternions) angles as Euler Vector, like "Vector3(yaw, pitch, fall)" in Radian
