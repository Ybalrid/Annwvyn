Todo list : 
Critial
- [X] Finish event system and remove the really bad and ugly gameplay code from the AnnEngine class
- [X] Have to set a shadow technique on the main scene manager BEFORE doing everything. 
- [ ] Need to think of a proper way of giving arguments to the engine befor graphical initialization...
- [ ] Allow playing multiple animations
- [ ] Create Annwvyn classes for representing vectors and quaternion relying on Ogre code + being able to convert itself to Bullet equivalent or other in-engine dependencies
- [X] (partialy done) Consolidate the audio system (but don't waste time, Oculus Audio SDK incoming, maybe...)

Non critial
- [ ] Add friction setting for bullet
- [ ] Object parenting
- [ ] Add debug drawing for trigger position when debug drawing is active for bullet
- [ ] Permit to create non spherical trigger
- [ ] Simplify the linux makefile template. Maybe make something to regenerate it from a list of files

Will probably not be added to the engine (map system has to be redone from scratch...)
- [ ] Add name identification for objects to be found in Map Files
- [ ] Add light vector to AnnMap Class
