Fix the physics :

- [ ] Rework the collision feedback system. 
- [ ] Re-implement trigger system with Bullet

TODO list : 

- [ ] Pipeline the rendering pass with a logic thread and a render thread
- [ ] Make the engine render a "loading screen" when loading resources/constructing levels
- [x] Use anti aliasing
- [x] Handle hand-controller event via the Event Manager **very basic for now**

Minor-level improvement:

- [ ] Object parenting
- [ ] Rework the animation system. Animation state should run in a *state machine automata* with proper transition programming
