Todo list : 
Critial
- [ ] Finish event system and remove the really bad and ugly gameplay code from the AnnEngine class
- [ ] Have to set a shadow technique on the main scene manager BEFORE doing everything. 
- [ ] Need to think of a proper way of giving arguments to the engine befor graphical initialization...
- [ ] Allow playing multiple animations
- [ ] Create Annwvyn classes for representing vectors and quaternion relying on Ogre code + being able to convert itself to Bullet equivalent or other in-engine dependencies

Non critial
- [ ] Add friction setting for bullet
- [ ] Object parenting
- [ ] Add debug drawing for trigger position when debug drawing is active for bullet
- [ ] Permit to create non spherical trigger

Will probably not be added to the engine (map system has to be redone from scratch...)
- [ ] Add name identification for objects to be found in Map Files
- [ ] Add light vector to AnnMap Class
