Todo list : 
Critial
- [X] Start to "ungodify" the AnnEngine class by removing everything that has something to do with bullet and collision testing from it.
- [X] Simplify the "timer" mess in AnnEngine
- [ ] Need a proper object factory for classes like AnnGameObject
- [x] Switch to the newest version of OVR. This will break the rendering pipeline. Hopefully it will be MUCH simpler to implement this time.

After finals : 
- [ ] Implement AnnLevelManager thanks to the class developed for the PST3 "Interface en Rélatié Virtuelle" during my 3rd year at ESIEA

Non critial :
- [x] Finish properly the implementation of the sound engine
- [ ] Add friction setting for bullet
- [ ] Object parenting
- [ ] Add debug drawing for trigger position when debug drawing is active for bullet
- [ ] Permit to create non spherical trigger
- [ ] Simplify the linux makefile template. Maybe make something to regenerate it from a list of files
- [ ] Allow playing multiple animations



Will probably not be added to the engine (map system has to be redone from scratch...)
- [X] Add name identification for objects to be found in Map Files
- [ ] Add light vector to AnnMap Class
