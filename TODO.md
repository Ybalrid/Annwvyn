Todo list : 
- [x] Expend event system
    - [x] Timmer events
    - [x] Trigger events
<del>    - [ ] Collision events </del>
- [X] Start to "ungodify" the AnnEngine class by removing everything that has something to do with bullet and collision testing from it.
- [X] Simplify the "timer" mess in AnnEngine
- [ ] Need a proper object factory for classes like AnnGameObject
- [x] Switch to the newest version of OVR. This will break the rendering pipeline. Hopefully it will be MUCH simpler to implement this time.
- [x] Simplify OgreOculusRenderer. There's too much member of that class.
- [ ] Add friction setting for bullet
- [ ] Object parenting
<del> Add debug drawing for trigger position when debug drawing is active for bullet</del>
- [x] Permit to create non spherical trigger
<del>- [ ] Simplify the linux makefile template. Maybe make something to regenerate it from a list of files</del>
- [ ] Allow playing multiple animations
