 *\mainpage Annwvyn Game Engine API Reference documentation
 *
 * Welcome to the Annwvyn API documentation.
 *
 * Here you'll find the complete & exhaustive documentation of the engine (last version avilable in the master branch at generation date).
 *
 * I strongly recomned you to go to <a href="http://wiki.annwvyn.org/">the wiki</a> to get a more comprehensible help to start using the engine.
 *
 * There is a quick-start tutorial you can check-out. At the moment, good knowledge of OGRE is required to basicaly do stuff.
 *
 * The aim of the project is to create something pretty strait-forward to make 3D interactive content. Making an high-level framework to create Oculus Rift compatible content.
 *
 * Enjoy your stay and make great virtual reality experiencies ;-)
